# Clarity
As a developer, I've been tasked with creating a website that houses a mindfulness game built with JavaScript, giving the user a calming and pleasant experience.

Please see initial design UX document available [here](https://github.com/CMecrow/CM-Project-2/blob/main/docs/clarity_ux.md) for further information on background and initial design brief, along with initial wireframe concepts [here](https://github.com/CMecrow/CM-Project-2/blob/main/docs/clarity_wireframes.pdf).

## Features
- ### Site header
- Site name 'Clarity' is central to the page to be the main initial focus. This is to provide a memorable and recognisable name / brand.
- A small image of a lotus flower was included to provide a logo to run through the site and also be included as a favicon for the page.
- Header includes a styled hr element to add more structure to the page, rather than the header bleeding into the page without any distinction eg colour changes. The code was taken and adjusted in colour from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9437400/css-fade-out-horizontal-rule-line-styled-div-effect-without-images) Stackoverflow page, linking to [this](http://jsfiddle.net/andresilich/fZNbK/1/) demo.

- ### Mindfulness JavaScript Game
- The game area is where the goals of the site are achieved.
- The game area has been built using vh and % dimensions so it will always be the main draw of the page. This is important because due to the nature of the game on a touch device, there can be no scrolling present, as discussed in the [testing file](https://github.com/CMecrow/CM-Project-2/blob/main/docs/testing.md).
#### Theme Selection
- The user is prompted to select a theme for the game through both taglines of 'Where shall we unwind today?' and 'Select your theme'. The buttons are designed to display to the user that they are interactive by changing the cursor to a pointer when mouseovered and also via drop shadow changes. If none of this is clear to the user, they can also get this information via the help button at the bottom of the section.
- It is important to have the 'Select your theme' text change to match the selection, ie 'Forest', 'Mountains' or 'Beach' because the chosen image is covered via the frost image, so it may not be clear to the user that their selection has occured at all.
